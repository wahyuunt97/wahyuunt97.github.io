## Project Overview

Finding delicious food in Batam is often reliant on word-of-mouth, with honest negative reviews being scarce due to social pressure. Secret Bitess solves this by providing a safe platform for anonymous, honest food reviews.

### Design Philosophy
- **Anonymity First**: UI designed to protect user identity while encouraging sharing.
- **Apple Standard**: Strictly follows apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a native feel.
- **User Centric**: Based on research into user hesitation regarding online reviews.
